# Changelog

All notable changes to the anti-hall plugin are documented here. The plugin pins an
explicit `version` in `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`, so every behavioral change
MUST bump the version or installed users will not receive the update.

## 0.2.1

- Fix `git-guard` self-credit regex: removed the bare `ai` alternation that
  false-blocked legitimate human trailers (e.g. `Co-authored-by: Ai ...`). Now matches
  specific AI/assistant signatures only.
- Add this CHANGELOG.

## 0.2.0

- Add skills: `root-cause` (evidence-driven debugging), `orchestration` (non-blocking
  swarm; Claude+Codex load split; commands via Haiku), `feature-launch` (plan-first,
  deadly-loop-hardened, edge-case/scenario simulated), `deadly-loop` (iterative
  Reviewer+Critic debate), and shared `MODEL-POLICY.md` (Opus + Codex roster).
- Add graphify hooks: `graphify-session` (SessionStart, query-graph-first) and
  `graphify-reminder` (Stop, keep-graph-updated).
- Add `git-guard` (PreToolUse/Bash): block self-credit commit trailers and force push.
- Add conditional statusline (rich for monorepos, simple otherwise) + installer.
- Strengthen `verify-first` injection: no-jumping-to-conclusions, no-cause-no-fix,
  instrument-don't-guess, no-fake-completion, label claims.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: `verify-first` UserPromptSubmit hook + marketplace scaffold.
